# Sentiment_Analysis_SmartSuriPreneur
Final year project during my studies doing sentiment analysis of customer reviews from Shopee for the use of the Smart SuriPreneur system.
The machine learning model was built using Python. It is an ensemble method where three models were combined which are SVM, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
The interface is built using Laravel/Livewire.
